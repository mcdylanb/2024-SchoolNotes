3. ﻿﻿﻿The social constructionist view emphasizes that a condition or behavior does not become a social problem unless there is a perception that it should be considered as such.    It is aligned with symbolic interactionism, which also underlines the subjective character of social problems.
4. ﻿﻿﻿Functionalism and Conflict Theory highlight the structural character of a social problem.
5. ﻿﻿﻿The continuity and change in social problem consists of four stages: emergence and claims making, legitimacy, renewed claims making, and alternative strategies.
