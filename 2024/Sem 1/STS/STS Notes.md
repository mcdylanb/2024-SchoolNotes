Biological

### Physics
particle physics
Particle accelerators

- sample of specialization
	- nuclear physics
	- quantom mechanics 
	- electromechanics

### Chemistry
Synthetic organic chemistry
**chromatography and spectroscopy**, allowed for more precise characterizations of organic compounds and facilitated the development of new synthetic methods.
- Organic checmistry
- inorganic chemistry


### **Geology**
Geophysics
**drones and autonomous vehicles for data collection**, alongside advancements in satellite technology, are enhancing the ability to survey and monitor geophysical phenomena, even in remote locations.
- archeology


### Astronomy



### Meteorology
- sample of specialization
	- Operational meteorology 

Meteorologists who work for government agencies and private businesses to predict weather changes that can impact industries like agriculture, energy, and event production

**doppler radar, radiosondes, weather satellites, buoys** and other instruments are fed into computerized NWS numerical forecast models. The models use equations, along with new and past weather data, to provide forecast guidance to our meteorologists.



two kinds of science

- example of technology before:
	- stone tools
	- different kind of stones used

- when did men dwell in caves?
- There are some cultures that are dependent with nature
	- reach to a point they dont need to upgrade technology
- When was the first evidence of fire
- when was the first evidence of cooking technology
- First evidence of plants domestication
- lksd


How they live and survive
- what were the strategies to live and survive
- need to understand what tools have been created to use for survive
- We use technology used by our ancestors to showcase the culture
- 


Studying Culture
Culture
- Ideals and beliefs 
- Social Facts
- can be tools and houses

- Qualities of Culture
	- learned  
	- shared  
	-  symbolic 
	-  integrated 
	-  adaptive.
" Culture, at the moment of birth, is what is going on around the individual, what the people in his/her social environment are doing. "
