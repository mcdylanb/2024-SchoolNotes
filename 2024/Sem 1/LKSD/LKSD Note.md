- Knowledge is generated by people sharing and jointly maintaining it.
- knowledge, such as theoretical, practical, and artisanal

Knowledge and its types
- Epistemology
	- theory of knowledge branch of philosophy
- knowledge
	- understanding of something
- Type of knowledge
	- priori
		- from before
		- reasoning
		- are using existing knowledge more likely in idea of natural knowledge
	- Posteriori
		- what comes later/ after
		- gained by after experience
		- uses the 5 senses
		- after analyzing the situation this is considered posteriori
			- imagine being asked regarding what the weather is outside
			- youll tend to use your five senses and compare it with previous experience to analyze what may possibly happen today

	- Explicit Knowledge
		- knowledge that is recorded and communicated through mediums
	- 
	- Tacit Knowledge
		- introduced 1950s
		- cannot be communicate through any medium
		- can only be achieved through experience
		- intangible knowledge
		- personal, context-sepecific and often unspoken
		- Example:
			- keen sense of aesthetic design
			- learning your native language
				- learned because we are in a community
			- in game coaching
	
	- Propositional Knowledge
		- knowing something
		- Example: Knowing someone is a musician
		- expressed in propositions
		- being told by someone
		- "that" Clause
		- Example:
			- if Susan knows that Alyssa is a musician, she has knowledge of the proposition that Alyssa is a musician

	- Procedural Knowledge
		- can be applied to something
		- can be claimed in the court of law 
		- acquired by doing
		- knowing how to ride a bicycle or play a musical instrument

		
	- Logical
		- understanding the relationship of ideas to one another
		- Example
			- a. is green
			- b. the color of the grass is green
			- c. therefore all grass are green
			- All spiders have eight legs
			- black widows are a type of spider
			- Black widow have eight legs
		- Cons:
			- as hominem fallacy
				- the reason you dont understand this proposal is because you're stupid.
	- Semantic
		- knowledge of words is knowledge of definition
		- general facts

	- Systematic 
		- relationship of systems working together
		- following a formula step by step
		- more like a system how we follow systematically step by step in solving a mathematical equaiton
		
	- Empirical
		- knowledge come to our senses, reasoning 
		- base on logic
		- need data

Professional Knowledge
- needs to accumulate over experience
Local Knowledge
- citizen
- religious
- cultural

The Thinker
- Auguste Rodin
- person lost in thought

Socrates
- socratic method 
> The Socratic method is a way of learning by asking questions. Imagine you're playing a game where instead of someone telling you the answer, they ask you questions to help you figure things out on your own. It's like solving a puzzle by thinking step by step.
> 
> For you as a developer, you can apply the Socratic method by asking yourself or your team thoughtful questions to solve problems. For example:
> 
>  - "Why is this code not working the way we expect?"
>  - "What assumptions are we making about how users will interact with this feature?"
>  - "How could we break this problem down into smaller parts?"

> By asking these kinds of questions, you can uncover hidden issues, explore different solutions, and make your code or project better without jumping straight to conclusions.
- 3 questions
	- what is good
	- what is right
	- what is just

Plato
the father of FORM
form like how we think of ideal
its like following standards in our code that are IDEAL 
questioning what form does this code should be
a blueprint of whats the best

> Plato's Theory of Forms says that everything we see around us is just an imperfect copy of a perfect version that exists somewhere else. Imagine you’re looking at a chair. Plato would say there's an idea or "Form" of a perfect chair that exists in a different world, and all the chairs we see are just copies that don't quite match up to that perfect idea.

As a software engineer, you can apply this by thinking about the "ideal" version of what you're building. For example:

- When designing an app, you have an idea in your mind of the "perfect" app—one that works smoothly, is easy to use, and has no bugs.
- The actual app you build might not be perfect (because of time, resources, or mistakes), but you always keep that ideal version in mind.
- Striving toward that ideal form helps you make better decisions, aiming to get as close as possible to the "perfect" version of your code, design, or system.

In practice, it means continuously refining your work, keeping in mind that while perfection may not be achievable, aiming for the best possible outcome will push you to improve.

Allegory of the cave
- thinking for yourself and discovering your own unique solutions to any problem.
- the idea to look for different perspective to understand the bigger picture
